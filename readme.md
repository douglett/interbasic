DONE:
-----
- continue statement
- automake object dims
- autofree array / object dims
- object/array pointers (references)
- automake array dims
- typed dims (system types)
- seperate owner pointers and reference pointers
- function memory dealloc
- better management of heap
- reworking expressions to have lazy evaluation
	- added missing expressions
- single-line dim list
- else / else-if
	- minor cleanup
- support for while nesting
- better handling of nesting
