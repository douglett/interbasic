InterBasic
==========

Interpreted basic. A simple test project, to prepare for the next compiler version.

Actually, this is the first language I have made which has actually worked! A real milestone.



TODO:
-----
- :)

DONE:
-----
- text adventure!
- fixed error in dim-list parsing
- typed array pointers (@ ?)
- typed arrays
- object pointers
- type destructor
- type constructor
- user defined object types
- continue statement
- automake object dims
- autofree array / object dims
- object/array pointers (references)
- automake array dims
- typed dims (system types)
- seperate owner pointers and reference pointers
- function memory dealloc
- better management of heap
- reworking expressions to have lazy evaluation
	- added missing expressions
- single-line dim list
- else / else-if
	- minor cleanup
- support for while nesting
- better handling of nesting
- codemap
- break while
- while loops
- array subscripts in expressions
- object properties in expressions
- first item

WONTDO:
-------
- type assignment (copy)
- reference counters?
- function calls in expressions 
	- actually, this will break the call stack so can't do this now
