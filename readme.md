InterBasic
==========

Interpreted basic.



TODO:
-----
- automake object dims
- object/array pointers
	- reference counters
-
- function calls in expressions 
	- actually, this will break the call stack so can't do this now

DONE:
-----
- continue statement
- autofree array / object dims
- automake array dims
- typed dims (system types)
- seperate owner pointers and reference pointers
- function memory dealloc
- better management of heap
- reworking expressions to have lazy evaluation
	- added missing expressions
- single-line dim list
- else / else-if
	- minor cleanup
- support for while nesting
- better handling of nesting
- codemap
- break while
- while loops
- array subscripts in expressions
- object properties in expressions
- first item
